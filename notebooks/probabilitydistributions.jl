md"Probability is a conserved quantity distributed over a space ``S``.  A probability distribution is then a mathematical description of how much of this conserved quantity, named probability, is assigned to (most[^1]) subsets ``A`` of ``S``, ``A \subseteq S``.  The set ``S`` is called the **sample space**."

md"**Example: Gas Station Keypads**.  Imagine you are at a gas station, about to enter the zip code associated with your credit card.  Have you ever noticed that the digits of the local zip codes are often more worn than the other digits?  In fact, the wear on the keypad describes a probability distribution over the sample space ``S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}``.  Probability is higher for, or distributed more to, the numbers of the digits of the local zip codes, and is lower for, or distributed less to, the other numbers.  Further, we should expect repeated numbers within the local zip codes to have higher probability than less common numbers of the local zip codes."

# ╔═╡ 18f3e3ce-9fd2-4a55-bcb2-5224f4bb943c
md"**Example: Fair Die**.  A fair die is a more common choice for a first example.  The sample space ``S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}`` and probability is evenly, or uniformly, distributed over the singletons (single element subsets) of ``S``."

# ╔═╡ 0dfb6258-4451-4d64-a704-9da3ec92ca07
md"**Example: Fair Coin**.  A fair coin with sides ``H`` for heads and ``T`` for tails is another common first example. A fair coin is another example of a uniform distribution of probability over its sample space ``S = \{H, T\}``.  A nice feature of this example is that the sample space is not numbers, thus highlighting the generality of probability distributions.  Probability distributions need not apply to sample spaces of only numbers.  The sample space ``S`` can really be almost any set."

# ╔═╡ 8aa81756-2bc5-462b-bbc2-84708fab3a70
md"The gas station keypad example above contrasts nicely against the next two examples.  The gas station keypad's distribution is a non-uniform distribution of probability (over singletons of the sample space), whereas the other two examples represent a uniform distribution (of probability over singletons of the sample space).  These three examples will thus help us generalize our concept of probability."

md"A probability distribution is any function that assigns a number, referred to as probability, to (most[^1]) subsets of a sample space and also satisfies the axioms of probability, provided below.  It is common to think of probability as a number, but in fact it is a function that assigns probability to subsets of ``S``.  After presenting the Axioms of Probability, we will generalize probability to from finite sample spaces to countable and uncountable spaces.  Then we will discuss some more complicated examples of probability distributions, to help ensure that we come away with a general concept of probability that can be more easily applied to new situations."

md"## Probability, a Set Function"

# ╔═╡ 2b0c948d-2eb1-461a-8999-0802b7e9e819
md"A probability distribution is a function that applies to subsets of the sample space ``S``.  Hence it is a set function.  For an arbitrary subset ``A`` of ``S``, ``A \subseteq S``, we write

$$\mathbb{P}[A] = p$$

for some ``p \in [0, 1]``. The specific value of ``p`` is determined by the specific distribution being used.  

* If ``\mathbb{P}`` represents a fair coin and ``A = \{H\}``, then we tend to believe ``\mathbb{P}[A] = \mathbb{P}[\{H\}] = 0.5``.
* If ``\mathbb{P}`` represents a fair die and ``A = \{1, 2\}``, then we would have ``\mathbb{P}[\{1, 2\}] = 2/6``.
* If ``\mathbb{P}`` represents a gas station keypad in Chico, CA, where the five local zip codes are ``(95926, 95928, 95929, 95973, 95976)``, then we might expect to see wear on local gas station keypads that, relatively closely, aligns with the probabilities ``\mathbb{P}[\{9\}] = 11/25`` and ``\mathbb{P}[\{5\}] = 5/25``, and ``\mathbb{P}[\{2\}] = 3 / 25``."

md"## A Note on Notation"

# ╔═╡ d7da0c9d-8f19-49d0-b093-1d0816b6c8ed
md"Statisticians have a bad habit of reusing the same name, namely the letter P which I write in bold as ``\mathbb{P}``, for different functions. In fact, we'll see this same issue again in the notebook on density functions."

# ╔═╡ 0774a8f8-e6d1-44dc-b186-d481b713ba00
md"There are an uncountable number of probability distributions.  It is common in the world of statistics to reference each one with ``\mathbb{P}``.  One hopes that the specific probability distribution under discussion is clear from the context, but one also imagines that navigating such distinctions is more difficult when first learning this material."

md"## Axioms of Probability"

# ╔═╡ 410b2fff-0ed5-4ff4-82c1-bc3409ffd0af
md"The three axioms of probability are

1. ``\mathbb{P}[A] \geq 0`` for (most[^1]) ``A \subseteq S``,
2. ``\mathbb{P}[S] = 1``, and
3. ``\mathbb{P}[\cup_n A_n] = \sum_{n} \mathbb{P}[A_n]`` where ``A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset`` and ``i \not= j``.
"

# ╔═╡ 1ad18652-cebf-4dfe-aa01-19834ba4b14a
md"The first axiom says that probability is bounded below by zero.  This should make intuitive sense, since we reasonably believe that probability can not be negative.  The second axiom suggests that probability is bounded above by ``1``, but technically says that the probability assigned to the entire sample space is ``1``.  Since any given probability distribution only assigns probability to subsets of the sample space ``S``, of which ``S`` is the biggest valid subset, we can not distribute more than 100% of our conserved quantity, known as probability.  The third axiom says that probability is assigned to a union of disjoint sets as the sum of the components of the union."

# ╔═╡ 427adede-fe09-4c59-b8ca-df898c4a7924
md"The third axiom of probability is often easier to interpret visually.  The entire box, let's call it ``A``, below is written as a union of disjoint sets ``A_n`` for ``n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}``,

$$A = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4 \cup A_5 = \cup_{n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}} A_n.$$"

md"Since the ``A_n`` are disjoint, we can apply the third axiom of probability to find the probability of ``A``,

$$\mathbb{P}[A] = \mathbb{P}[\cup_{n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}} A_n] = \mathbb{P}[A_1] + \mathbb{P}[A_2] + \mathbb{P}[A_3] + \mathbb{P}[A_4] + \mathbb{P}[A_5] = \sum_{n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}} \mathbb{P}[A_n].$$"

md"Probability distributions dictate the assignment of probability to arbitrary subsets of the sample space.  Only in the simplest of cases do probability calculations become calculations of the number of elements in the subset ``A`` relative to the number of elements in an enclosing space, which is often but not always the sample space ``S``, such as

$$\mathbb{P}[A] = |A| / |S|.$$

Notice that this definition immediately won't apply to countable nor uncountable sample spaces."

# ╔═╡ 272ce517-d9ec-4afe-b5c1-90d6c4c89899
md"In general, probability is defined to be area under a probability distribution's  density function.  See the notebook on [TODO add link to] Density Functions for more details.  For now, we will assume that a density function of a probability distribution is the function that enables the assignment of probability to subsets of the sample space."

# ╔═╡ f10cecb7-cb04-43ee-8db0-f623d99115c1
md"Luckily, defining probability as area under a density function conforms to ``\mathbb{P}[A] = |A| / |S|`` when ``\mathbb{P}`` represents a uniform distribution (of probability) over a finite sample space ``S``, and enables more complex definitions of probability.  Let's start with the fair die example from above."

# ╔═╡ b284dddb-2da3-4e93-9ecb-b6592dcab087
md"Many common probability distributions are grouped into named families.  Although, not all distributions are so classified.  For instance, the gas station keypad example above is an example of an unnamed probability distribution.  On the other hand, the fair die example above is an example of a Uniform distribution over a finite sample space, also known as a discrete Uniform distribution.  Named families of distributions are indexed by a (or many) values called **parameter(s)**.  Within a family of probability distributions, a new distribution is formed for each new value of the parameter(s)."

# ╔═╡ fcfc666e-758a-48e5-8b53-99e749b6231b
md"**Family of Uniform Distributions**.  The (discrete) Uniform (probability) distribution is a probability distribution that assigns equal weight to each element of its finite sample space, ``S`` where ``|S| = N`` for some integer ``N``.  The Uniform distribution can be applied to any space of finite elements, but it is common to enumerate the elements with the integers ``1, 2, 3, \ldots, N.``  So even if the sample space ``S`` does not consist of only integers, it is common to consider the sample space to be integers, where each element of the space of interest maps one-to-one into the integers up to the number of elements ``N``.  When the sample space consists of consecutive integers ``S = \{a, \ldots, b\}``, we insist ``a < b`` and write this distribution as ``U(a, b)``."

# ╔═╡ 1ba39836-ad38-49c1-a942-52cec59e651d
md"Notice the Uniform distribution on the integers ``a`` to ``b``, namely ``U(a, b)``, actually specifies an entire family of distributions, where ``a`` and ``b`` are the parameters.  In applied statistics, there is two ways to use this distribution as a model.

1. Assume the parameters ``a, b`` are known and use this distribution to calculate probabilities.

    A fair die puts ``a = 1`` and ``b = 6``.  By modeling a fair die as a (discrete) Uniform distribution, ``U(1, 6)``, we could calculate ``\mathbb{P}[\{2, 5, 4, 6\}] = 4/6``.


2. Assume the parameters ``a, b`` are uknown and estimate them from data.

    With dataset ``\{1, 5, 3, 4\}``, we might estimate ``\hat{a} = 1`` and ``\hat{b} = 5``.  Even if these data came from four rolls of a fair die, where we know ``b = 6``, the esimates ``\hat{a} = 1`` and ``\hat{b} = 5`` are not unreasonable given the data we have."



# ╔═╡ 589e0cf2-a8e6-41a0-af0d-6176b58e337a
md"For some ``A \subseteq S = [a, b]``, the probability distribution for ``U(a, b)`` is given by

$$\mathbb{P}[A] = \frac{|A|}{|S|}.$$
 
This distribution is almost intuitive as it assigns probability to a set by counting the number of elements in the set of interest, namely ``A``, and dividing it by the number of elements in the sample space ``S``.  It is common to see ``|S| = b - a + 1``, when ``S = [a, b]``, as this is a well known shortcut to count consecutive integers."

md"A point of clarity is in order.  Statistics authors often fail to mention the family component of probability distributions at all.  It is hard to blame such authors for neglecting this naunce.  As you'll see here, typing/saying, for instance, the Binomial family of probability distributions quickly becomes exhausting.  As such, I too will likely fail to mention the family aspect in all but these opening paragraphs.  Further, I'll probably even refer to probability distributions as, simply, distributions."
